# Advanced Calculator App

## üìö About the Project

This is an **Advanced Calculator App** built using **Streamlit** and Python, offering a wide range of mathematical functions. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) and trigonometric calculations (sine, cosine, etc.) with a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the app saves the calculation history so users can refer to past operations.

### Aim:
The aim of this project is to provide an interactive calculator app with:
- Basic arithmetic and trigonometric operations.
- The ability to view calculation history.
- A user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the logic behind the app.
- **Streamlit**: A powerful framework to create interactive web applications with minimal effort.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), etc.
- **Session State**: To manage application state and persist history across multiple calculations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modular Division.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant.
- **Calculation History**: Keep track of all previous calculations.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple and easy-to-use interface for selecting operations and inputting values.
- **Restart or Terminate**: Option to restart the app with initial values or terminate the session.

To run this app locally, you need Python installed on your machine. You also need to install the required libraries, which can be done via `pip`.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Calculator-App.git
   cd Calculator-App
   ```
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**:

    ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the App**:

    ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
    
  >This will start the app in your default browser.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use

1. **Choose Operation**: On the left sidebar, select the operation you want to perform, such as Addition, Subtraction, or Trigonometric functions.
2. **Enter Numbers**: Input the numbers for basic operations or the angle (in degrees) for trigonometric calculations.
3. **Click on "Calculate"**: After entering the necessary values, click the "Calculate" button to get the result.
4. **View Results**: The result will be displayed immediately, and the history will be updated with your calculation.
5. **View History**: Select "History" to view all previous calculations made during the current session.
6. **Restart/Terminate**: After each calculation, you can choose to continue with a new calculation, restart the app, or terminate the session.
